# NER Annotation Tool

Explore the interactive NER Annotation Tool! This is build using python and pyqt5 to aid in creating the annotated datasets for training and/or validation for Natural Processing Language tasks. 

## Overview

The tool (currently) takes a JSON file as input containing text data and outputs a JSON file with annotated entities. You can always reuse your previous work from the output JSON and start working from there.

## Features

- Annotate Named Entities: Easily annotate Named Entities in text data using an intuitive graphical interface.
- Support for Multiple Entity Types: Annotate multiple types of Named Entities, including names, organizations, locations, dates, and custom entities.
- JSON Input and Output: Input text data in JSON format and export annotated data to a JSON file, making it easy to integrate with existing data pipelines.
- Customizable Annotation Scheme: Customize the annotation scheme to match your specific requirements, including defining custom entity types and annotation rules.   

> ## Future Directions  
> - The input from a raw text file instead of JSON
> - A better UI can be added
